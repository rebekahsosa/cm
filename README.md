# Assignment 2: Website Analysis + Github RepoÂ¶

Part A:

Explore different approaches to creating websites by analyzing existing sites and learning about the technologies they are built with. Evaluate different options such as content management systems (CMS), free/paid templates, hand coding HTML/CSS pages, etc. Locate 3-4 websites you find interesting and comment on the pros and cons of the site design and organization. What works? What doesn't? Good design? Bad design? Good UX? Bad UX? Possible places to start: Look at portfolio sites, creative agency sites, image based or image oriented sites like those used in photography or art direction, look at sites that portray a product or service in an appealing way, sites you frequently visit, project blogs, websites that document a project or creative process, etc. The purpose here is to begin to understand how the Internet works and how websites work.

In critical making we place emphasis on the creative process and understanding the successes, failures, and happy accidents that inform and guide the creation of an idea and perhaps product. Possible uses for a website like this: documenting a project, course, series of projects, workflow, tracking your growth and progress, a portfolio showcasing your ideas from start to finish and the lessons learned along the way, or some combination of all the above. As consumers of information and projects about making things and how to make things we acknowledge the work that people like ourselves put in to transmitting ideas for others to learn and grow from. We want to always pay it forward and be content creators in the digital space, and a website like this can achieve that goal. Visit Instructables to see examples of documenting projects for others to follow. Personal sites, like the following, are quality examples of project oriented coursework. Chikara Inamura (HTMAA 2014), Matt Keeter (HTMAA 2011), Christos Tzamos(HTMAA 2014), Zach Seibold (HTMAA 2014), Merav Gazit (HTMAA 2014)

Deliverable: A thoughtful commentary on the sites you have evaluated. Post your response to slack #cmstudio or (optionally and for gold stars) create a repo as instructed in Part B and commit your commentary to this repo and post the repo link. "Repo" = Short for Git Repository. If you find yourself asking, "what makes this website look or work this way?" just right click on the page and choose "View Page Source" or "Inspect" (if using Google Chrome).

Part B:

Create a Github account and go through a Git and Github tutorial. Learn about how to make a project and commit it to a repo.
