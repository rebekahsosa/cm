Assignment 2

## [Collective Quarterly] (http://www.collectivequarterly.com/)
### Squarespace

Collective Quarterly is an online magazine about discovery through travel. The authors travel to one place per issue and share stories about uncommon people, places and things from around the world. The website is pretty clean and has nice, full-size visuals. I really like the photo carousel on the opening page. Squarespace offers simple templates that can be useful for throwing a website together quickly. The downside is that the website can look clunky. The nav bar on the Collective Quarterly website is overlapping with a box to sign up for the newsletter. One of the other challenges is matching custom content with a ready-made template. These two components don't always work well together. The articles on the site are well formatted, but the main page seems to scroll down indefinitely with no real objective. While Squarespace can be helpful in a pinch, it's probably better to create a custom site if you have a lot of personalized content.
