## Collective Quarterly (http://www.collectivequarterly.com/)
### Squarespace

Collective Quarterly is an online magazine about discovery through travel. The authors travel to one place per issue and share stories about uncommon people, places and things from around the world. The website is pretty clean and has nice, full-size visuals. I really like the photo carousel on the opening page. Squarespace offers simple templates that can be useful for throwing a website together quickly. The downside is that the website can look clunky. The nav bar on the Collective Quarterly website is overlapping with a box to sign up for the newsletter. One of the challenges of using a template is matching custom content with a ready-made template. Having used these sites, this can feel like fitting a square peg into a round hole. The user may be forced to create content around the template if they aren't familiar with the tools. While the articles on the site are well formatted, the main page seems to scroll down indefinitely with no real objective.

Upon further inspection of the source code, it would appear that Squarespace is built on html, css and javascript. Considering the monthly subscription rate, it might be worth learning some basic front-end skills to create a custom site.


## [Instructables] (http://www.instructables.com/)
### HTML, CSS, Javascript

Instructables is a site to share what you make through words, photos and video files. From a UX perspective, the site is simple, clean and easy to follow. The search box at the top of the page allows the user to quickly find a specific project or scroll through a list of ideas below. Following the steps to create something is equally as satisfying. Projects include simple instructions, photos and videos to guide the user through even the most complex creations. The site is built in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The source code reveals a bootstrap template and a Jquery library. I wouldn't have guessed that this site was built with bootstrap. Unlike Squarespace and other template-based websites, bootstrap does require some coding skills and therefore may be a barrier to entry for non-coders.

These two components don't always work well together. The articles on the site are well formatted, but the main page seems to scroll down indefinitely with no real objective. While Squarespace can be helpful in a pinch, it's probably better to create a custom site if you have a lot of custom content.
