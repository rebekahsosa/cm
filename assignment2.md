## Collective Quarterly (http://www.collectivequarterly.com/)
### Built in Squarespace

Collective Quarterly is an online magazine about discovery through travel. The authors travel to one place per issue and share stories about uncommon people, places and things from around the world. The website content is pretty interesting and contains several nice visuals. Squarespace offers simple templates that can be useful for throwing a website together quickly. It also provides options for people who don't know how to code. The downside is that these website can look clunky. The nav bar on the Collective Quarterly website is overlapping with a box to sign up for the newsletter. One challenge in using a template is matching custom content with a ready-made template. Having used these sites, this can feel like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The user may be forced to create content around the template, or visa versa.

While the articles on the site are well formatted, the main page seems to scroll down indefinitely with no real objective. Upon further inspection of the source code, I realized that Squarespace is built on HTML, CSS and Javascript. That seems obvious now, apparently I don't spend enough time looking under the hood of websites! Considering the cost of the monthly subscription, it might be worth learning some basic front-end skills to create a custom site. Overall, Collective Quarterly has some interesting content, but the information architecture could use a facelift.


## Instructables (http://www.instructables.com/)

Instructables is a platform to share things you make. From a UX perspective, the website is simple, clean and easy to follow. The search box at the top of the page allows the user to quickly find a specific project or scroll through a list of ideas below. Following the user flow of the steps to create a project is equally as satisfying. Projects include simple instructions, photos and videos to guide the user through even the most complex creations. While the site is built in HTML, CSS and Javascript, the source code reveals a bootstrap template and a Jquery library. Unlike Squarespace and other template-based websites, bootstrap does require some coding skills, but also allows for more customization. Bootstrap seems like a good starting place for people who have some development skills, but may not know how to build something out completely from scratch. I've heard about the marvels of Jquery for things like animation, I look forward to learning more about these tools.

## Awwwards (https://www.awwwards.com/)
### Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript

Awwwards is a flashy website created to provide awards in design, creativity and innovation on the internet. The site is aesthetically pleasing to the eye providing a feast of stunning photographs, videos, motion graphics and overall beautiful designs. This is a great site to find inspiration and follow creative folks in the industry. The layout is elegant and easy to follow, but can be a little overwhelming. All of the bright colors and moving objects can be distracting. The site is custom built in the front-end stack, I didn't see any libraries or templates in the source code. One of the cool things about Awwwards is that you can easily check out the technologies that other people are using for their projects. The site also rates usability, creativity and content.

 While I appreciate the aesthetic qualities of this website, I do question its main purpose. Providing captivating content for the design community seems a bit too altruistic. The site also provides a directory of digital agencies, design resources and a conferences. Where does this site ultimately want to lead its visitors? To book a conference? Listing a design agency? I'm not totally sure, but I suspect that the bread and butter of the company isn't simply providing content.
